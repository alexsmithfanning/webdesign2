# Web Design II finished & unfinished project files

Original files for the **uncompleted portions** are in the `resources` folder.

The lesson I'm currently working on and have not yet finished is in the `working` directory.

Lessons I have completed are in the `finished` directory.

The `book` folder is designed for lesson specific sections of the book, in case they are provided.

**Do not directly copy my work. It is meant as a reference if you are having difficulties on a specific lesson we've completed in class.**
